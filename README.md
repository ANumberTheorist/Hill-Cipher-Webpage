# Hill Cipher Webpage

(GitHub Mirror to [this GitLab Repository](https://gitlab.com/mathnerd/hill-cipher-webpage))

Web page for Hill Cipher implementation. Will be used for demo to High School students.

Uses Boost.Beast to create a WebSocket server. It also depends on my [Hill Cipher](https://gitlab.com/mathnerd/hill-cipher) implementation, which itself depends on my [Integers Modulo N](https://gitlab.com/mathnerd/integers-modulo-n) and [Minimal Matrix](https://gitlab.com/mathnerd/minimal-matrix) implementations.

Creates an HTML file with the necessary HTML, JS, and CSS automatically and opens it up. Execution ends when WebSocket connection is lost (typically from closing the browser tab).
